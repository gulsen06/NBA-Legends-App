# NBA Legends App

## Description

This project is a simple React application that showcases NBA legends and their basic statistics. The project fetches data from an external data.js file and creates player cards and a header using this data.

The Header.js component creates the header section of the application and provides search functionality.

The CardContainer.js component lists the player cards by taking the data and using the PlayerCard.js component to create each player's card.

The PlayerCard.js component creates each player's card and displays basic statistics.

The data is stored as an array in the data.js file and is used by the application..
